# Algorithmic-Efficiency
Analysis of data sorting algorithms and BigO classwork 

Selection Sort algorithm and Merge Sort algorithm performance. 
Running the programs will generate a graph through matplotlib that highlights the performance of each algorithm, while 
the console output displays the running time for the same series of input sizes.
